# GitHub Portfolio 🌏

This portfolio houses a collection of some Python and R scripts I have developed to facilitate my research at Climateworks Centre. These scripts primarily serve to streamline our energy systems and land use optimisation modelling to aid our research into understanding the complexities associated with a nature-positive, energy transition in Australia.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### **1. AusTIMES data processing and visualisation**
A Python-based tool to calculate energy use by fuel across ANZSIC subsectors, normalise emissions baselines, and streamline scenario processing.  
Key Features:
- Automates energy use data processing for multiple scenarios.
- Handles large datasets with flexible input paths for user-specified subsector representation.
- Data visualisation for annual 'Electricity generation mix' split by technology and region (state).
- National electricity market (NEM) Random Forest electricity price forecasting.

### **2. Land Use Trade Offs Model (LUTO2)**
Geospatial land use optimisation model developed to create sustainable land use pathways that factor in geographical, social, environmental and climate constraints.  
Key Contributions:
- Development of five agricultural management solutions, enabling modelling of sustainable land management decisions and policy analysis.
- Integration of solar PV and wind energy generation modeling (in progress).
- Integration with AusTIMES energy and emissions outputs to ensure coherent pathways.

### **3. "Renovation Pathways" Australian Residential Housing Renovation Analysis**
Visualisation of renovation economic analysis data 
Key Features:
- Interactive Shiny application visualising marginal abatement costs for different residential renovations in Australia. Can be easily split by state, upgrade type ['Quick-fix'; 'Modest'; 'Climate-ready'] and housing type ['House'; 'Townhouse'; 'Appartment'] according to user preferences. Other outputs developed and visualised include: cost-benefit box and whisker plots, net present value column charts, and average energy bill savings bar charts. 
- These outputs were used in the publication of Climateworks Centre's ['Climate-ready homes: Building the case for a renovation wave in Australia'](https://www.climateworkscentre.org/resource/climate-ready-homes-building-the-case-for-a-renovation-wave-in-australia/) report
