# Virtual Workshed 🌏

My virtual 'shed' houses a collection of some Python and R scripts I have developed during my professional and academic research. The professional scripts are primarily serve to streamline Climateworks Centre's energy systems and land use optimisation modelling in support of our research into understanding the complexities associated with a nature-positive, energy transition in Australia.

## 📂 Professional Projects

### **1. AusTIMES data processing and visualisation** 📉
A Python-based tool to calculate energy use by fuel across ANZSIC subsectors, normalise emissions baselines, and streamline scenario processing.  
Key Features:
- Automates energy use data processing for multiple scenarios.
- Handles large datasets with flexible input paths for user-specified subsector representation.
- Data visualisation for annual 'Electricity generation mix' split by technology and region (state).
- National electricity market (NEM) Random Forest electricity price forecasting.

### **2. Land Use Trade Offs Model (LUTO2)** 🌳
Geospatial land use optimisation model developed to create sustainable land use pathways that factor in geographical, social, environmental and climate constraints.  
Key Contributions:
- Development of five agricultural management solutions, enabling modelling of sustainable land management decisions and policy analysis.
- Integration of solar PV and wind energy generation modeling (in progress).
- Integration with AusTIMES energy and emissions outputs to ensure coherent pathways.

### **3. Australian Residential Housing Renovation "Renovation Pathways" Economic Analysis** 🛠🏠
Visualisation of renovation economic analysis data 
Key Features:
- Interactive Shiny application visualising marginal abatement costs for different residential renovations in Australia. Can be easily split by state, upgrade type ['Quick-fix'; 'Modest'; 'Climate-ready'] and housing type ['House'; 'Townhouse'; 'Appartment'] according to user preferences. Other outputs developed and visualised include: cost-benefit box and whisker plots, net present value column charts, and average energy bill savings bar charts. 
- These outputs were used in the publication of Climateworks Centre's ['Climate-ready homes: Building the case for a renovation wave in Australia'](https://www.climateworkscentre.org/resource/climate-ready-homes-building-the-case-for-a-renovation-wave-in-australia/) report

## 📁 Personal Projects
### **1. AFL player stats puller** 🏉
This small script pulls data about Australian Football League players from 'afltables' to inform various records such as win/loss rates and winning/losing margins when specific players achieve a certain feat during any given game.

## **2. Officiating bias in Australian Rules Football: A statistical analysis** 🏉
Pet project study that studies the drivers of free kick (penalty) data in the AFL between the 2012-2019 seasons. This baseline data is used to compare with the crowdless, 'unprecedented' 2020 AFL season to uncover whether the 'noise of affirmation' affects officiating quality in the AFL.
