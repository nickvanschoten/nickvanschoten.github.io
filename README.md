# Virtual Workshed 🌏

My virtual shed houses a collection of some Python and R scripts I have developed during my professional, academic and personal research. The professional scripts primarily serve to streamline Climateworks Centre's energy systems and land use optimisation modelling in studying the complexities of a nature-positive energy transition in Australia.

## 📂 Professional Projects

### **1. AusTIMES data processing and visualisation** 📉
Python-based tools to calculate energy use by fuel across ANZSIC subsectors, normalise emissions baselines, and streamline scenario processing.  
Key Features:
- Automates energy use data processing for multiple scenarios.
- Handles large datasets with flexible input paths for user-specified subsector representation.
- Data visualisation for annual 'Electricity generation mix' split by technology and region (state).
Also produced some price forecasts in R to inform the partial-equilibrium energy model, AusTIMES: 
- National electricity market (NEM) Random Forest electricity price forecasting.

### **2. Land Use Trade Offs Model (LUTO2)** 🌳
Geospatial land use optimisation model developed to create sustainable land use pathways that factor in geographical, social, environmental and climate constraints.  
Key Contributions:
- Development of five agricultural management solutions, enabling modelling of sustainable land management decisions and policy analysis.
- Integration of solar PV and wind energy generation modeling (in progress).
- Integration with AusTIMES energy and emissions outputs to ensure coherent pathways.

### **3. Australian Residential Housing Renovation "Renovation Pathways" Economic Analysis** 🛠🏠
Visualisation of renovation economic analysis data 
Key Features:
- Interactive Shiny application visualising marginal abatement costs for different residential renovations in Australia. Can be easily split by state, upgrade type ['Quick-fix'; 'Modest'; 'Climate-ready'] and housing type ['House'; 'Townhouse'; 'Appartment'] according to user preferences. Other outputs developed and visualised include: cost-benefit box and whisker plots, net present value column charts, and average energy bill savings bar charts. 
- These outputs were used in the publication of Climateworks Centre's ['Climate-ready homes: Building the case for a renovation wave in Australia'](https://www.climateworkscentre.org/resource/climate-ready-homes-building-the-case-for-a-renovation-wave-in-australia/) report

## 📁 Personal Projects

### **1. AFL player stats puller** 🏉
This small script pulls data about Australian Football League players from 'afltables' to inform various records such as win/loss rates and winning/losing margins when specific players achieve a certain feat during any given game.

### **2. Officiating bias in Australian Rules Football: A statistical analysis** 🏉
Pet project study that studies the drivers of free kick (penalty) data in the AFL between the 2012-2019 seasons. This baseline data is used to compare with the crowdless, 'unprecedented' 2020 AFL season to uncover whether the 'noise of affirmation' affects officiating quality in the AFL.
